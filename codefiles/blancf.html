<p >Blancpain was founded in 1735 and belongs to the Swatch Group (Breguet, Omega, Longines, Swatch). For many years during the 20th century Blancpain was out of business and did not sell any watches. In the 1980s Blancpain was revived and today enjoys considerable success among collectors.</p>
<p>
he 500-piece 2019 edition of the original diving watch from the 1960s embodies a perfect combination of vintage design and advanced technicality. Its black dial is punctuated with large red and white hour-markers. The luminescent pencil-shaped hands are white-lacquered, while the date – a key element of the original model – returns to its favourite position in a prominent window. The unidirectional bezel features a scratch-resistant, domed sapphire insert, and is enclosed in a satin-brushed steel case. Water-resistant to 300 metres, it has a diameter of 40mm which is a size reserved for Fifty Fathoms timepieces in limited series. Powered by the Calibre 1151 self-winding movement. Comes with a tropical rubber strap identical to that of the historical models.

While retaining many of the key features that has made it an iconic diver’s watch over the last six decades, this new edition comes with a 45mm red gold case and a blue ceramic dial. The DNA of the collection remains identifiable at first glance: numerals, hour-markers and hands coated with luminescent material, a slightly curved scratchproof sapphire crystal and a ratcheted unidirectional rotating bezel. The movement powering the watch features a very dense red gold oscillating weight that ensures high winding efficiency for an optimal five-day power reserve when fully wound. The watch comes with a blue calf leather strap to match the blue ceramic dial.

This latest addition to Blancpain’s classic Villeret collection is an ultra-slim dress watch that concentrates only on the bare essentials, displaying just the hours and minutes. The 40mm case is just 7.39mm thick, which makes it even thinner than the current Villeret ultra-plate iterations. Available in polished stainless steel or 18K red gold, the case features Villeret’s traditional double-stepped bezel. The dial is off-white for the red gold version and silvery-white for the stainless steel variant and it features gold applied Roman numerals paired with elegant open-worked leaf-shaped hands. Powered by the hand-wound Calibre 11A4B with a power reserve of 100 hours</p>
