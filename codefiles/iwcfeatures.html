<p >ounded in 1735 by Jehan-Jacques Blancpain in the Swiss Jura, Blancpain is known as the world’s oldest watch brand. Respect for history, mixed with a spirit of innovation and a taste for the provocative, offer Blancpain an inexhaustible source of ideas and inspiration. Blancpain is determined to push the boundaries of its inheritance through constant self-renewal and continuing to set the standards of watchmaking excellence. The strength of the Manufacture lies in its capacity to create timepieces that are at once innovative and loyal to the grand Swiss watchmaking tradition. This philosophy is conveyed through each of the brand’s
creations and all its collections. Over the years it has invented countless complications, remaining ever-faithful to its tradition of innovation, and this quest for invention still drives the Master Watchmakers of the Manufacture today.

he  1983, SSIH sold the Rayville-Blancpain name to Jacques Piguet, son of Frédéric Piguet and director of the company of that name, and Jean-Claude Biver, at that time employed by the SSIH.[3] The company set up production at Le Brassus, in the Joux Valley, and from then on traded under the name of Blancpain SA.
In 1992, the SSIH purchased Blancpain back for 60 million Swiss Francs. At that time, Blancpain had annual sales of 50 million Swiss Francs. Jean-Claude Biver remained as CEO of Blancpain until 2002. Marc Hayek, the grandson of the Swatch Group's founder and chairman, Nicolas Hayek (1928 – 2010), has run Blancpain since 2002.[7][14]
Later, SSIH became known as the Swatch Group, and in July 2010, Frédéric Piguet SA, also owned by Swatch Group, was merged into the firm Blancpain SA. Currently, Blancpain is an active member of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH.[15]
