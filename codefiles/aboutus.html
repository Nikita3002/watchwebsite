<h2>THE IDEA</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="+2">The idea for the site came about because people were often asking for advice about which watch they should buy. The more this happened — and it happened a lot — the more we realized that searching for a watch online is a minefield of information.
The individual brand websites are great, but there are hundreds of watch brands in Switzerland alone, so checking out each page individually would take you weeks, and that’s if you know the names of all the brands.
There is nowhere you can really search for all the new watches on the planet, compare models, check prices, and discover new brands all in the same place. That is, until now!</font></p>
<h2>THE WATCH SEARCH</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="+2">The Watch Pages features over 160 brands and thousands and thousands of watches (and it is growing every week). If you are a newbie to our industry, searching for a watch is as simple as finding a vacation home on Airbnb, – you just choose your preferences in our filters and let our search find you the perfect watch. And if you are a bit of an expert, you can have a lot of fun with our advanced filters and search watch functions and complications to your heart’s content.
In addition to the most amazing watch database you will ever find, the website also includes numerous articles to give you ideas, to help you make the right purchase and discover more about the wonders of watches.</font></p>
<h2>INFO</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="+2">Reasons why you should trust TheWatchShop.in    With your purchase
100% genuine watches.  Every item sold by TheWatchShop.in is a 100% genuine item, supplied to us from the manufacturer directly.  We do not sell second hand or replica watches.
We are official retailers for all of our brands. This means all of our stock comes directly from the manufacturer and therefore comes with the correct instructions, packaging and 100% valid guarantee.  Many sites out there, allow third parties or independent sellers to sell on their websites, who will import from the ‘grey market’ – meaning your watch could be from a number of countries such as China and NOT include the official guarantee.
Full refund policy.  If for any reason you are unhappy with your purchase, as long as it is in brand new and unworn condition, you can return it to us for a full refund or exchange within 7 days of delivery. 
Free delivery.  We do not charge anything extra for delivery unlike other sites & the final price on our sites includes the delivery charges as well. We deliver to most locations across India through our logistical partner Bluedart.
If it says In Stock, it’s In Stock.  We have a live stock tracking system which means our physical stock is represented accurately on our website: if it’s shown as being in stock on our site that means that we have the item in stock and ready for processing.  Many sites out there list hundreds of watches on their site and wait until they receive your order before they try and obtain the watch from their sources, causing delays of days or weeks.  In the unlikely event that a watch is not available, we will contact you immediately. 
100% secure online ordering.  Your credit card details are directly entered on the HDFC Bank’s Secure Payment gateway which, means that they cannot be intercepted or read by anyone.  Also your credit card details are not stored with us & are directly logged on to the banks secure server.</font></p>
