<p >Festina are a Swiss brand best known for producing wristwatches. You may have seen their recent advertisements featuring their ambassador, Hollywood actor Gerard Butler.
Despite this recent shift towards lifestyle marketing, for years Festina sponsored sporting events including the famous Tour De France bicycle race. In fact, for 12 years they had their own professional cycling team, racing under the Festina banner.

Coming into the 1998 season, Festina had a star-studded line-up and were considered by many the number one cycling team on the planet. However, a shocking event would seal the fate of this once popular squad. Days before the start of the 1998 Tour De France event, officials discovered a large haul of over 400 doping products in one of the Festina support cars, including performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids. Camera teams were present to beam the embarrassing footage of their banning around the world.
Major investigations followed, which ultimately resulted in several teams withdrawing from the race and a string of arrests being made. By December 2000, all of the Festina riders had admitted to using these drugs during the contest and jail sentences were handed out to several Festina staff members. 
While doping was suspected to be in widespread usage at this point, the incident nonetheless destroyed the reputation of the Festina team and led to their demise less than 12 months later.
