<p >1. Track your workout
How many steps did you walk today? Have you made it to the first mile marker yet? Is it time to start the next move? A digital watch has all the answers. With the ability to record time elapsed and distance traveled, digital watches make it easy to track your workouts. Whether you run every day or spend hours in the gym, your digital watch can track your progress and help you set goals to keep improving.</p>

2. Check your heart rate
Some digital watches can also monitor your heart rate. This feature is especially ideal for runners or those who want to track cardio-heavy workouts. You can also store the data and check the history of your pulse scores to compare results.
Plus, with digital time and data display, digital watches can be easier to read than analog watches while in motion. This display allows you to steal a quick glance at the time or your heart rate when you’re on the move while the high-tech features record your progress as you go. Light-up watch dials mean this easy reading continues even when the sun goes down.

3. Cross the finish line
Coupled with the ability to track physical activity, lightweight construction and easy-on-the-wrist materials digital watches are the perfect companions for any sport. If you’re playing for a team, coaching the players, training for a marathon or triathlon, competing professionally or using recreational sports as an entertaining way to stay in shape, you’re the perfect candidate for a digital watch.

4. Get outdoors
More than an athlete’s preferred wristwatch, digital timepieces can also support adventure-seeking spirits who love exploring the outdoors. Features such as weather, water and shock resistance, compass and GPS, customizable alarms and reflector displays mean digital watches are dependable and practical companions for anything from hiking to camping to snorkeling. Plus, digital watches keep working even when there isn’t enough service for your smartphone to pull up directions.
